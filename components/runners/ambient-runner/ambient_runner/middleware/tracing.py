"""
AG-UI Tracing Middleware — Langfuse observability for the event stream.

Wraps an adapter's ``async for event in adapter.run(...)`` stream to:

1. Track turns, tool calls, and usage in Langfuse (via ObservabilityManager)
2. Emit a ``CustomEvent`` with the Langfuse trace ID once available
3. Finalise the turn trace on ``RUN_FINISHED``

Usage::

    from ambient_runner.middleware import tracing_middleware

    async for event in tracing_middleware(adapter.run(input), obs=obs, model=model, prompt=prompt):
        yield encoder.encode(event)

The middleware is transparent — if ``obs`` is ``None`` it simply yields events
unchanged with zero overhead.
