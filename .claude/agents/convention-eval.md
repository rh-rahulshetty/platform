# Convention Evaluation Agent

Evaluate codebase adherence to documented conventions. Produce a scored report.

## Context Files

Load these before running checks:

1. `specs/standards/backend/conventions.spec.md`
2. `specs/standards/backend/error-handling.spec.md`
3. `specs/standards/backend/k8s-client.spec.md`
4. `specs/standards/frontend/conventions.spec.md`
5. `specs/standards/frontend/react-query.spec.md`
6. `specs/standards/control-plane/conventions.spec.md`
7. `specs/standards/security/security.spec.md`

## Checks by Category

| B6 | No tokens in logs | Blocker |
| B7 | Error wrapping with %w | Major |
| B8 | Files under 400 lines | Minor |

### Frontend (8 checks, weight: 25%)

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| F1 | No raw HTML elements | Critical |

| O3 | SecurityContext on Job pods | Critical |
| O4 | Resource limits/requests | Major |
| O5 | No `panic()` in production | Blocker |
| O6 | Status condition updates | Critical |
| O7 | No `context.TODO()` | Minor |

### Runner (4 checks, weight: 10%)

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| R1 | Proper async patterns | Major |
| R2 | Credential handling | Blocker |
| R3 | Error propagation | Critical |
| R4 | No hardcoded secrets | Blocker |

### Security (7 checks, weight: 20%)

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| S1 | User token for user ops | Blocker |
| S2 | RBAC before resource access | Critical |
| S3 | Token redaction | Blocker |
| S4 | Input validation | Major |
| S5 | SecurityContext on pods | Critical |
| S6 | OwnerReferences on Secrets | Critical |
| S7 | No hardcoded credentials | Blocker |

## Scoring

- Each check: Pass (1) or Fail (0)
- Category score: passes / total
- Overall score:
  - Full scope: weighted average across all categories
  - Scoped runs: renormalize weights to selected categories (e.g., backend-only uses 100% backend weight)
